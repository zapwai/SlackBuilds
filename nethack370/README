----

This package can safely be installed alongside NetHack 3.6.7

By default the build includes Curses, X11, and Qt. The SlackBuild can 
be edited to remove that support. To run with a windowing system use:

nethack370 -wcurses
nethack370 -wx11
nethack370 -wqt

The SlackBuild includes a desktop launcher which runs Qt.
Change to x11 by editing /usr/share/applications/nethack370.desktop

(Note that a new update may conflict with old saved games
located in /var/lib/nethack370/save)
